### SmartSDR v3.x API (Flexlib) 3.4.23

This is a port of the Flexlib library that has been retargeted to support netstandard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.6.2 and .NET Framework 4.8.

Portions of the UiWpfFramework project have been excluded from the netstandard 2.0 build since they are not cross platform, but all radio API functions work.
